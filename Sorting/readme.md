# Sorting Homework 

* the floder Sorting_Algorithm contains the implementations of the homework of 31/30/2020 and 2/4/2020 

* the report1.pdf the performance analysis of the algorithms, as required in the homwork of  31/30/2020, and the theoretical exercises assigned in that same date. 

* the report2.pdf contains a brief description of the implementation of quick sort with a generalized version of the select algorithm to deal with repeated value, a performance and complexity analysis of quick sort. It also contains the theoretical exercises assigned the 31/30/2020.
